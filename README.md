# Digit-Recognition-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
## Overview:
This project involves implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing numeric characters. The primary dataset for training and testing is the MNIST dataset. The project is structured to guide you through understanding, implementing, and applying CNNs to real-world digit recognition tasks. The project is divided into five parts, focusing on different aspects of CNNs and their application in image recognition.

## Objectives:
1. Understand and implement the components of a CNN: Gain a deep understanding of the convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and activation functions.
2. Implement forward and backward propagation: Write code for forward and backward passes in a neural network, enabling the CNN to learn from data.
3. Train and test the network: Use the MNIST dataset to train your CNN and evaluate its performance on test data.
4. Visualization: Understand and visualize the intermediate outputs (feature maps) of the CNN to interpret how the network processes and understands images.
5. Apply the trained model to real-world images: Use the trained CNN to recognize digits from real-world images, understanding the challenges and preprocessing steps involved in dealing with real-world data.
   
## Key Components:
1. Data Preprocessing: Understand how to preprocess images for feeding into a CNN.
2. Layer Implementation: Implement various types of layers (Convolutional, Pooling, Fully Connected, Activation) from scratch.
3. Forward and Backward Propagation: Implement the forward and backward passes for training the CNN.
4. Training the Network: Set up a training pipeline, including setting hyperparameters, initializing weights, and optimizing the loss function.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix.
6. Real-world Application: Implement a pipeline for preprocessing real-world images, detecting digits, and recognizing them using the trained CNN.
